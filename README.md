## HOW TO PLAY
You can play the game in one of two modes: Direct or Flip. In both cases, your main objective is to dodge incoming pillars by navigating through the small gaps between them.

#### Direct Mode
Direct mode requires the potentionmeter to be put under tension, holding it at the point of lowest resistance.
In this mode, your objective is to dodge the incoming pillars by timing well-measured jumps to get between the gaps.
In order to do this, you must pull back the paddle, and let go. Your jump height will be based on how far back you moved the paddle before releasing it.

#### Flip Mode
Flip mode requires the potentiometer to not be under tension, letting it spin freely.
In this mode, you objective is to dodge the incoming pillars by changing the vertical position of the dot.
In order to do this, you must rotate the paddle. Your character's veritcal position will be based on how far counter-clockwise the potentiometer is rotated.
